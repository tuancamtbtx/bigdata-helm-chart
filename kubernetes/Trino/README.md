## Running Trino using Helm#
Run the following commands from the system with helm and kubectl installed and configured to connect to your running Kubernetes cluster:

1. Validate kubectl is pointing to the correct cluster by running the command:
```
kubectl cluster-info
```
You should see output that shows the correct Kubernetes control plane address.

2.Add the Trino Helm chart repository to Helm if you havenâ€™t done so already. This tells Helm where to find the Trino charts. You can name the repository whatever you want, trino is a good choice.
```
helm repo add trino https://trinodb.github.io/charts
```

3. Install Trino on the Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart. Start by running the install command to use all default values and create a cluster called example-trino-cluster.

```
helm install example-trino-cluster trino/trino
```

This generates the Kubernetes configuration files by inserting properties into helm templates. The Helm chart contains default values that can be overridden by a YAML file to update default settings.

```
helm install -f example.yaml example-trino-cluster trino/trino

```
